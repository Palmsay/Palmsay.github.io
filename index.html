		<p> <div align=left> What's good, fam? Welcome to Palmsay's (Insecure) Digital Insanity! I know boys finna be sayin' this page look like it fresh outta 2003. Little do these broke mf's know that this was my goal! Vintage HTML sites are the OG days of boys trappin' boomin' over the IP's! Burr! My HTML coding sucks so this page is prolly prone to getting fucked. Oh well. Also, this page insecure as fuck, fam! No HTTPS here! Fuck tha 'ops! I feel like a fuckin' suburban white wine mom off the Xanies writin' a fuckin' food blog back in 2004 or whatever. I don't really give a fuck. This isn't my most successful project and I don't ever want it to be. Any ape-lookin' headass with 10 minutes of spare time can make a basic ass HTML 'site on the 'net (as the cool kids say). I don't even know where I'm gonna host this fucker yet. Prolly like on some Dropbox shit or something weird. How the fuck does web hosting still cost money in 2017? That shit wack.</p> </div>

		<p> <div align=left> Second day editing more shit to this site. Minor updates but hey it's fuckin' something. Hoping to actually host this piece of shit somewhere on the webz, fam. See you on the other side just like the fuckin' Mexicans. </p> </div>
		<pr> <div align=left> Also added the Windows 95 startup sound once you access the website. Originally it was the "welcome to your doom" sample. fuck. i love samples. also, i've realized spelling punctuation and other bullshit doesnt matter here anymore. fuck it. it only took me like 5 days total from the origins of this html document inside textwranger to get fuckin pissed off. </p> </div>
